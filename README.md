# **INFO201 FINAL PROJECT | PROPOSAL**  

**Project Code Name:** Global Terrorism  
**Authors:** Joseph Altamira, Jazmynn Combes-Troyer, Dorothy Lu

**Affiliation:** Info-201: Technical Foundations of Informatics  
The Information School  
University of Washington  
Autumn 2019  

## 1.0 INTRODUCTION PROBLEM SITUATION  
### 1.1 Problem Situation:

Describe the general problem situation – Who are the stakeholders? What is the setting of the problem? What values and tensions are in play? What policy and ethic
elements may exist? [60-100 words]  

Terrorism is the unlawful and systematic use of violence against a state, country, or group of people, motivated by various ideologies, as a form of political coercion. Direct stakeholders include political entities (i.e. a government, political figure, or organization), both as targets and instigators. Indirect
Stakeholders: Political entity, indirectly civilians
Setting: International
Values: Political
Policy and ethics: humanitarian policies, human protection  

### 1.2 What is the Problem?
[60–100 words]. - Jaz
Terrorism targets innocent civilians, often resulting in death. The Global Terrorism Index has catalogued over 170,000 terrorist incidents between  2000 and 2004
Causes political unrest

### 1.3 Why Does It Matter?  
Terrorism affects individuals, communities, and societies on multiple levels.  Aside from the obvious physical and psychological impacts on direct victims of terrorism, terrorism causes deep-rooted fear and insecurity within affected populations.  This uncertainty for safety also has direct effects on the economy (both direct economic destruction and market uncertainty) to the political health of the State.  

### 1.4 How Will it be Addressed?  
How will you address the problem [60–100 words]
Raising awareness for smaller countries, especially those that do not get media attention. A non-discriminatory data viz.

The sensitive subject of terrorist attacks will be addressed by bringing attention to the underlying issues that bring forth terrorism and its subsequent political violence. By understanding the root causes and finding correlations between various data about those attacks (date, location, cause, etc.) can bring more awareness to aspects of terrorism. Helping us understand these variables of terrorism can potentially help with prevention and perhaps lower the severity of the attacks.

## 2.0 RESEARCH QUESTIONS  
Given the problem situation and your discussion of the problem, propose two specific research questions. - Joseph
What can we find using this data set?
Publicized attacks vs recorded.

## 3.0 POSSIBLE DATASETS  
Describe two possible data sets that you might work with. Include name, short description [30-60 words], link, and number of observations and number of attributes. - Jaz

## 4.0 INFORMATION VISUALIZATIONS
Present two possible information visualizations that might help you address the problem. In two captions, describe how they work [30-100 words] - Dorothy

_Figure 1_. This graphic shows the impact of terrorism by country.  By using progressing shades of red to differentiate how much each country is impacted on the world map, viewers can see trends of where terrorism has the largest influence by area.  

_Figure 2_. This graphic shows the global number of deaths by terrorism per year, highlighting key events and differentiating countries with the highest death rates. By charting the countries with the highest death rates in comparison to the rest of the world, viewers can see how high the impact of terrorism is within those countries.


## 5.0 TEAM COORDINATION  
### 5.1 When Can the Team Meet?  
The team will plan to meet weekly for at least two hours on Fridays from 10:00AM to 12:00PM. Additional meeting times will be scheduled, especially near the deadlines for deliverables.

### 5.2 How Will the Team Communicate?  
The group will use Facebook Messenger for all communication.

### 5.3 How Will the Team Give and Receive Feedback?  
> “Communication is the lubrication of any good relationship.” - Boundless Boi in B CMU  

Feedback on deliverables will be given to each other through Google Doc comments as well as through Messenger before they are due.  All feedback will be polite and constructive, and will never be a direct attack against a team member.  
If there are any communication challenges, we will address it through messenger first.  If the problem is not able to be resolved, we will schedule a group meeting to further probe the issue.  In the case that the problem cannot be resolved through discussion alone, we will talk to a TA or schedule a meeting with the professor.  

### 5.4 What Are Our Individual Goals and Roles?  
**Joseph:** To create a project that can be used as an aid to those who want to spread awareness of a global issue and allow discourse into a subject that many people tend to avoid because of political correctness.    
**Jazmynn:** To create a clean, polished product that I can include in my portfolio and to gain insight about international political and humanitarian issues, as those are subjects in which I am not well-versed. I would also like to further develop and expand my proficiency in R.  
**Dorothy:** To increase my proficiency in R using a project reflective of real-life data visualization projects while exploring global issues, as well as to create a portfolio piece I can be proud of.

**Roles:** Each group member will contribute an equal amount to the design and technical development of the final product, as each member would like more experience in each aspect (design, development, research, etc.) of this project.

## 6.0 QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS  
We have no questions or comments about the project at this time.
